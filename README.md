### Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I'm Lance Dolan!

I've been a career software engineer since 2004. It's been a wild ride with a lot of technologies!

What a great career to get into ❤️ It allowed me to see all corners of the world and even live in Australia for a year 🇦🇺

### 2004-2011
- Started a freelance business in college. Custom wordpress integrations <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/php/php-plain.svg" alt="php" width="20" height="20"/>
- Senior Engineer @ MNDOT: lots of Spring/Struts/Hibernate/JSF. Anyone remember PrimeFaces?! Good times.
- Failed Startup ☹️ thebigdealcoupons.com - PrimeFaces on JBoss and MySQL. So many lessons learned building a business from scratch! 👨‍🎓

### 2011-2014
- Consulting for Citytech Inc (Now ICF International)
- Lots of Adobe AEM (formerly CQ). Apache Sling, and an unfortunate amount of JSP 😝
- Exciting clients 🚀🚀🚀 like Sony Playstation, General Electric, Fisher Scientific, Ingersoll Rand, Zebra Technologies, Commenwealth Bank of Australia, FairFax Media

### 2014-2016
- Founded Epic Gamer LLC. Made some neat apps, such as [LOL Ping Test](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freelance_webs.lolpingtest&hl=en_CA&gl=US). 
- Some contracting work in southern California.

### 2016-2021
- Architect & Manager @ Edlio, LLC. 
- Lots of modern microservices (node + mongo) integrated into a legacy monolith (tomcat + mysql)
- This was the advent of the microservice. We learned a _lot_! First and foremost: don't make them too small and numerous. Build microservices, not nanoservices 😜
