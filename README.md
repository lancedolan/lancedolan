I've been a career software engineer since 2004. It's been a wild ride with a lot of technologies!

What a great career to get into ❤️ It allowed me to see all corners of the world and even live in Australia for a year 🇦🇺

### 2004-2011
- Started a freelance business in college. Custom wordpress integrations <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/php/php-plain.svg" alt="php" width="20" height="20"/>
- Senior Engineer @ MNDOT: lots of Spring/Struts/Hibernate/JSF. Anyone remember PrimeFaces?! Good times.
- Failed Startup ☹️ thebigdealcoupons.com - PrimeFaces on JBoss and MySQL. So many lessons learned building a business from scratch! 👨‍🎓

### 2011-2014
- Consulting for Citytech Inc (Now ICF International)
- Exciting clients 🚀🚀🚀 like Sony Playstation, General Electric, Fisher Scientific, Ingersoll Rand, Amway Global, Zebra Technologies, Commenwealth Bank of Australia, FairFax Media
- Adobe AEM (formerly CQ). It's a world-class CMS that Adobe charges millions for (literally). 
- Apache Sling & OSGI, Apache Solr, Backbone/Angular, NoSQL graph database, and an unfortunate amount of JSP 😝


### 2014-2016
- Founded Epic Gamer LLC. Made some neat apps, such as [LOL Ping Test](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freelance_webs.lolpingtest&hl=en_CA&gl=US)(now outdated, not compatible with Android 8.0+)
- Some contracting work in southern California.

### 2016-2021
- Architect & Manager @ Edlio, LLC. 
- Lots of modern microservices (node + mongo) integrated into a legacy monolith (tomcat + mysql)
- Tremendous Let's Encrypt integration. Automated cert and renewal of ~50k domains for 10k customers and new customers arriving daily. This isn't your normal certbot solution 😆
- Automated video captions via Google Cloud. Built a UI for realtime caption editing. 🥇
- React Native: produced a mobile app from scratch that surpassed and replaced our primary mobile offer 😲
- Lot's of career building for my team members. This is secretly my favorite part of the gig 💓
- These years were the advent of the microservice! We learned a _lot_. First and foremost: don't make them too small and numerous. Build microservices, not nanoservices 😜

### 2021-2022
 -  Senior Engineer at <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Amazon_Web_Services_Logo.svg/2560px-Amazon_Web_Services_Logo.svg.png" alt="aws" width="30" height="20"/>
